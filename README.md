## What's wrong?

Have a look at the code. It works, but is it clean and [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself)?

What could be done better?

List everything that can be improved and describe possible problems with the current code.

## Refactor

Refactor the code to use components.

Separate data and UI.

## Material
